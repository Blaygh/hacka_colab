It wasn't a pesky virus or a malware mosquito; it was literally a bug! Back in the ancient times of 1947, when computers wore lab coats, the Harvard Mark II had a glitch. Grace Hopper, the computer scientist, traced it back to an actual moth stuck in one of the relays. Talk about a bug causing a bug! They promptly removed it and documented the 'first actual case of bug being found.' I guess we can say that was the original computer 'hack'â€”courtesy of Mother Nature. Remember, when your code is acting buggy, it might just need a good swat... or a can of virtual insect repellent!"
